<p>This course will be an introduction to modularity lifting and the Taylor&ndash;Wiles method. Initially developed by Taylor and Wiles to prove the modularity of semistable elliptic curves over the rationals, their eponymous method has been refined and generalized by many and has become an indispensable tool in the study of Galois representations and automorphic forms. </p>

<p>We will focus on the case of GL(2) over both totally real and CM fields, briefly discussing what happens in higher rank. Along the way, we will also indicate applications of the Taylor&ndash;Wiles method beyond modularity lifting.</p>

	<a href="http://virtualcampustour.mcgill.ca/en/details/15/trottier-building">ENGTR</a> and/or online. 
	The lectures held in 1090 ENGTR will be streamed via Zoom. 
	Some lectures will be held stictly via Zoom; 
	check the course log below for how a specific lecture will be delivered. 
	(We may eventually settle into a regular routine. Stay tuned!) 
	In either case, the lectures will be recored and links posted below in the course log. 

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Besides the basics of algebra and number theory, knowledge of classical modular forms and of group cohomology will be useful. But we will try to fill in necessary background as needed.</p>

<p><b>Evaluation:</b> Parts of this course will be conducted in a seminar style and students will be required to give some presentations.</p>
